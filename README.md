# COMAP-2014-Cellular-Automata
This project is an answer to a question from the 2014 COMAP Math Modeling Competition regarding the modeling and of freeway traffic. It contains a report, simulation, and visualization of my team's solution. Our solution at the time was unique because we modeled freeway traffic with a modified verion of Nagel-Schreckenbergs Cellular Automata model; our model supported multiple lanes.

## Note
The visualizer found under Visualizer/TrafficMain.class shows traffic moving to the right. The big areas of purple and white are the areas where traffic is forming. Also our traffic environment is a circuit so vehicles always circle back to the left side.
